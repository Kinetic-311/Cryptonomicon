1. Bounties provide a mechanism for funding tasks. 
1. Tasks are tracked as [Cryptonomicon issues](https://github.com/cryptotechguru/Cryptonomicon/issues).
1. The bounty MUST get its own page which includes:
* name (Bounty-#) where # is the task #
* lead [Gatekeeper](/Cryptonomicon/Roles/Gatekeeper)
* lead [Keymaster](/Cryptonomicon/Roles/Keymaster)
* assigned [Treasurer](/Cryptonomicon/Roles/Treasurer)
* associated project link
* requirements
* estimate
* bounty address 
1. Requirements (acceptance criteria) are managed by the Gatekeeper.
1. An estimate (from the table below) is provided by the Keymaster.
1. The Gatekeeper and Keymaster SHOULD negotiate requirements and estimates until they come to a common understanding.
1. The Treasurer is responsible for publishing a unique BTC address for each task.
1. The Treasurer MAY release the bounty to the KeyMaster only when the Gatekeeper marks the task as completed.
